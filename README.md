# -01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor

1st Challenge

## Editing Semantic HTML:

I was tasked with editing 2 files, one HTML and one CSS, to improve the semantic HTML – with a view to making it more accessible to the blind.
I used VS Code to edit the 2 files, as it is an excellent code editor. I also used GitHub to reverse any errors that I made.
The challenge here for me, was getting used to HTML changing the CSS files execution. I am still baffled by it, so I need to double down on my CSS study. I also found things that I didn’t like about the website that I wanted to change, for instance, the H1 header looked awful on the page, for someone who is a dyslexic, it was difficult to read and I would have changed the “seo” in Horiseon to a different colour, so that it stood out more. I didn’t, as I didn’t want to make changes that were not asked for.
I also found it difficult to do the screenshot without the assign coming beneath the webpage, when the website works on Chrome. Also, linking the website to the README was very difficult.

## How to use the project:

The above screenshot shows how the user experience on the Horiseon screenshot upload and on the website do not correlate. I can’t figure out why, but it is something that I will discover in the future, I am sure.
The user should scroll down the webpage to see the whole site.
